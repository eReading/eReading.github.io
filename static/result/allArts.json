        "content": "is a small Czech town nestling in a valley on the German border. In 1534, though, it was Joachimsthal, the largest city in Bohemia apart from Prague and home to the almighty thaler\u2014a weighty silver coin that became the de facto currency of Europe and the New World. The thaler lent an English version of its name, \u201cdollar\u201d, to the money of the United States and a score of other jurisdictions. Joachimsthal\u2019s silver rush began in 1512. By the middle of the century the local mines were the most prolific in Europe.\n\nJoachimsthal\u2019s mines left another legacy, however: lead. Silver and lead often co-mineralise, and refining silver from its ore releases some of that lead into the atmosphere, where winds can carry it far and wide. Lead transported in this way to the Arctic often ends up trapped in layers of glacial ice. That is where a team of researchers led by Joseph McConnell of the Desert Research Institute, in Reno, Nevada found it, in ice cores pulled from glaciers in Greenland and Siberia.\n\nIn their new study, published in the\n\n, Dr McConnell\u2019s team used coring to analyse lead emissions and produce a record of the European economy from Roman to modern times. Moreover, by comparing records from Greenland and Siberia, Dr McConnell could distinguish mines in western and eastern Europe. Eastern mines left more lead in Siberia than in Greenland, and western ones the reverse.\n\nThe data illuminate the historical record. As Charlemagne conquered most of western Europe, his mints turned out huge quantities of new silver currency. After his reign, his empire disintegrated and smaller potentates took over minting. Silver production rose gradually but steadily through the prosperous medieval warm period. Conflict punctuates the record, as combatants fought over mining regions.\n\nDisease, too, makes its terrible impact plain. Major modern economic shocks, like the Great Depression, have taken a decade or so to recover from. By comparison, the Black Death halved lead levels, and it took 100 years for them to recover afterwards. The implication is that silver mines were unprofitable\u2014either because of a lack of demand, or of a shortage of affordable labour, or both\u2014well into the Renaissance. When plague recurred across Europe in the late 16th and 17th centuries, growth in lead emissions stalled as well.\n\nAfter 1750, industrial processes overtook silver production as the chief source of lead pollution. Leaded gasoline, introduced in the 1930s, sent lead levels still higher. Starting in the 1970s, environmental policies in America and Europe decoupled lead pollution from economic growth. Arctic lead levels have since fallen by more than 80%\u2014but they remain 60 times higher than in the medieval era.",

        "content": "IT CAN be horribly difficult to tax tech giants\u2019 profits. They stash their intangible capital, such as intellectual property, in tax havens, booking only low profits elsewhere. There were screaming headlines in 2018 when it was uncovered that Amazon\u2019s British subsidiary paid \u00a31.7m ($2.2m) in corporate tax despite revenues of $11.4bn. Rich countries have haggled over how to reform the global tax system, making progress in a number of areas, but not on taxing tech. Now France, it seems, has had enough./n/nOn July 11th it passed a bill allowing it to levy 3% on the French revenues of big internet firms\u2014those with at least \u20ac750m ($844m) of revenue worldwide and \u20ac25m ($28m) within France./n/nThat has not gone down well at the White House, which says the measure unfairly takes aim at American companies like Google and Amazon. On the eve of the French vote, the United States Trade Representative said it would investigate France under Section 301, legislation that allows it to defend itself against discriminatory actions abroad, and which it has already used to levy tariffs on China. Expect similar measures, perhaps hitting French exports such as cheese, to follow./n/nSome think France\u2019s unilateral action is mis-timed. Several European countries, Britain among them, are mulling digital-services taxes. But all say they would prefer a global deal, which the OECD, a club of rich and middle-income countries, is trying to broker. France\u2019s action, critics say, could now undermine that multilateral process. What is more, a world in which different countries imposed different digital tax regimes would be horribly messy./n/nThat may be true. Yet some European countries feel frustrated that America has dragged its feet over the OECD plans\u2014precisely, they suspect, because it wants to protect its largest firms. A back-up plan had been to levy a digital-services tax across the European Union. But that move has been stymied in part because some smaller European countries also have an interest in maintaining the status quo, particularly those, like Ireland, whose generous tax regimes have helped them attract the European headquarters of big tech firms./n/nFrance says that its digital tax will last only until there is a global agreement that will replace it. Furthermore, says Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, tax is a \u201csovereign matter\u201d./n/nSuch notions should hold sway at the Trump White House. The president is not a big fan of big tech firms (Jeff Bezos, the boss off Amazon, also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper that he detests). His administration and Congress are threatening greater regulation of Silicon Valley firms. But foreign governments demanding a slice of their profits or revenues may be a different matter. A statement by Amazon declared: \u201cWe applaud the Trump Administration for taking decisive action against France and for signalling to all of America\u2019s trading partners that the US government will not acquiesce to tax and trade policies that discriminate against American businesses.\u201d/n/nUnderlying everything is a sense within America that Europeans, with few digital champions of their own, have reserved a special vindictiveness for world-dominating Silicon Valley firms. The European Commission has in recent years levied billions in fines against Google over anti-competitive practices. The Irish government was ordered to claw back $15bn from Apple in 2016, after the commission ruled it had offered the firm a sweetheart deal. Facebook, too, could be hit for alleged privacy breaches. All this at a time when America and the EU are discussing a trade deal. Those talks have hit a wall. France has just added another brick.",

        "content": "A British warship stops Iran seizing an oil tanker 3\nhttps://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Ushitukiiwa_ZH-CN5710944706_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp\nFOR the third time in as many months, the crew of an oil tanker found themselves at the centre of an international incident. The British Heritage, a vessel owned by BP, a British oil firm, was sailing east through the Strait of Hormuz on July 10th when three Iranian gunboats allegedly tried to halt its passage. They soon backed down and allowed the tanker to continue\u2014but only because it was trailed by the HMS Montrose, a British warship. Reports suggest that the frigate had trained its guns on the Iranian boats. The latter would have been manned not by Iran\u2019s regular navy but by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which operates small attack craft in the Gulf.\n\nThe Guards deny there was any \u201cconfrontation\u201d with a tanker, British or otherwise. Such denials ring increasingly hollow\u2014not least because, days earlier, a guards commander threatened to seize a British vessel. His threat was a response to the capture on July 4th of the Grace 1, a Panama-flagged tanker laden with Iranian crude that was raided by British marines as it passed off the coast of Gibraltar.\n\nBritain says it seized the Grace 1 because its cargo was destined for Syria, which is under European sanctions. But to Iran the incident looked like another front in America\u2019s campaign of economic warfare. Since May 2018, when Donald Trump withdrew from an agreement that swapped sanctions relief for limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, his administration has applied ever-harsher measures to choke Iran\u2019s economy. Analysts estimate that its oil exports in June fell as low as 300,000 barrels a day (b/d), barely one-tenth of the 2.5m b/d it shipped before Mr Trump withdrew from the deal.\n\nAfter a year of restraint, Iran has begun to strike back. Until now, though, it has done so in ways that offered a dubious measure of deniability. Four oil tankers were sabotaged in May near the United Arab Emirates\u2019 port of Fujairah, and two others were damaged by explosions in the Gulf of Oman last month. Diplomats in the Middle East have little doubt that Iran or its allies were responsible, and America has blamed Iran, but investigators have not yet assigned blame for either incident. America and Iran came close to blows last month after it shot down an American surveillance drone near the Strait of Hormuz; Mr Trump rescinded his order for retaliatory strikes moments before they were due to take place, and was reported to have ordered a cyberattack instead.\n\nThe standoff with the British Heritage is the first time Iran has taken aim at one of the remaining state parties to the nuclear deal. Relations between Britain and Iran have long been bristly, and the two have on occasion been involved in naval confrontations. In 2007, for instance, IRGC naval forces surrounded and captured a boarding party of 15 British sailors off the coast of Iraq and Iran; they were released a fortnight later.\n\nOn the nuclear front, Iran has also started to ignore its own commitments under the 2015 agreement. First it broke a 300kg limit on the amount of low-enriched uranium it may stockpile. Then it started enriching the stuff to 5% purity, above the agreed-upon 3.67% limit. That is still far short of the 20% threshold that would put it on a quick path to weapons-grade uranium. But it is a second clear violation, and Iran has threatened further breaches every 60 days unless the other signatories help it cope with America\u2019s unilateral sanctions.\n\nOn July 9th the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany called for a joint meeting of the deal\u2019s remaining parties. They have not yet invoked the deal\u2019s dispute-resolution panel, which they view as a last resort: the lumbering mechanism could end with the United Nations restoring multilateral sanctions on Iran. That would sink the deal for good. At some point, though, they will have no choice but to convene the body.\n\nCritics of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy lament, rightly, that the president does not know what he wants to achieve. Aides have variously called for regime change, a grand bargain that reshapes Iran\u2019s foreign policy or a slightly tougher arms-control agreement. Mr Trump has, at times, seemed to embrace all three goals. Europe has the opposite problem. It has a clear objective\u2014preserving the agreement\u2014but no practical means to achieve it. Major European firms will not risk American sanctions to do business in Iran. Instex, a \u201cspecial-purpose vehicle\u201d meant to allow humanitarian trade, took a full year to set up and will not help much. Its starting capital of only a few million euros is laughably small.\n\nAs the threats to shipping mount, America wants to set up a coalition to escort vessels in both the Gulf and the Bab al-Mandab, a narrow passage off the coast of Yemen that leads to the Suez Canal. A Saudi military spokesman claimed on July 8th that the Houthis, a Yemeni militia with ties to Iran, tried to attack a commercial ship in the strait earlier this week (though the Saudis have provided no evidence). That seems sensible enough: Wednesday\u2019s incident could have been much worse if the British Heritage had lacked a naval escort. But it is also a sign that America only expects this crisis to worsen.",

Diplomats in the Middle East have little doubt that Iran or its allies were responsible, and America has blamed Iran, but investigators have not yet assigned blame for either incident. America and Iran came close to blows last month after it shot down an American surveillance drone near the Strait of Hormuz; Mr Trump rescinded his order for retaliatory strikes moments before they were due to take place, and was reported to have ordered a cyberattack instead.\n\nThe standoff with the British Heritage is the first time Iran has taken aim at one of the remaining state parties to the nuclear deal. Relations between Britain and Iran have long been bristly, and the two have on occasion been involved in naval confrontations. In 2007, for instance, IRGC naval forces surrounded and captured a boarding party of 15 British sailors off the coast of Iraq and Iran; they were released a fortnight later.\n\nOn the nuclear front, Iran has also started to ignore its own commitments under the 2015 agreement. First it broke a 300kg limit on the amount of low-enriched uranium it may stockpile. Then it started enriching the stuff to 5% purity, above the agreed-upon 3.67% limit. That is still far short of the 20% threshold that would put it on a quick path to weapons-grade uranium. But it is a second clear violation, and Iran has threatened further breaches every 60 days unless the other signatories help it cope with America\u2019s unilateral sanctions.\n\nOn July 9th the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany called for a joint meeting of the deal\u2019s remaining parties. They have not yet invoked the deal\u2019s dispute-resolution panel, which they view as a last resort: the lumbering mechanism could end with the United Nations restoring multilateral sanctions on Iran. That would sink the deal for good. At some point, though, they will have no choice but to convene the body.\n\nCritics of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy lament, rightly, that the president does not know what he wants to achieve. Aides have variously called for regime change, a grand bargain that reshapes Iran\u2019s foreign policy or a slightly tougher arms-control agreement. Mr Trump has, at times, seemed to embrace all three goals. Europe has the opposite problem. It has a clear objective\u2014preserving the agreement\u2014but no practical means to achieve it. Major European firms will not risk American sanctions to do business in Iran. Instex, a \u201cspecial-purpose vehicle\u201d meant to allow humanitarian trade, took a full year to set up and will not help much. Its starting capital of only a few million euros is laughably small.\n\nAs the threats to shipping mount, America wants to set up a coalition to escort vessels in both the Gulf and the Bab al-Mandab, a narrow passage off the coast of Yemen that leads to the Suez Canal. A Saudi military spokesman claimed on July 8th that the Houthis, a Yemeni militia with ties to Iran, tried to attack a commercial ship in the strait earlier this week (though the Saudis have provided no evidence). That seems sensible enough: Wednesday\u2019s incident could have been much worse if the British Heritage had lacked a naval escort. But it is also a sign that America only expects this crisis to worsen.",

The British Heritage, a vessel owned by BP, a British oil firm, was sailing east through the Strait of Hormuz on July 10th when three Iranian gunboats allegedly tried to halt its passage. They soon backed down and allowed the tanker to continue\u2014but only because it was trailed by the HMS Montrose, a British warship. Reports suggest that the frigate had trained its guns on the Iranian boats. The latter would have been manned not by Iran\u2019s regular navy but by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which operates small attack craft in the Gulf.\n\nThe Guards deny there was any \u201cconfrontation\u201d with a tanker, British or otherwise. Such denials ring increasingly hollow\u2014not least because, days earlier, a guards commander threatened to seize a British vessel. His threat was a response to the capture on July 4th of the Grace 1, a Panama-flagged tanker laden with Iranian crude that was raided by British marines as it passed off the coast of Gibraltar.\n\nBritain says it seized the Grace 1 because its cargo was destined for Syria, which is under European sanctions. But to Iran the incident looked like another front in America\u2019s campaign of economic warfare. Since May 2018, when Donald Trump withdrew from an agreement that swapped sanctions relief for limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, his administration has applied ever-harsher measures to choke Iran\u2019s economy. Analysts estimate that its oil exports in June fell as low as 300,000 barrels a day (b/d), barely one-tenth of the 2.5m b/d it shipped before Mr Trump withdrew from the deal.\n\nAfter a year of restraint, Iran has begun to strike back.

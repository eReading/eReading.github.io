How about a \u201cbeautiful\u201d photo-book of North Korean ships illegally transferring oil at sea? Patrick Shanahan, America\u2019s acting defence secretary, presented the collection of grainy aerial shots to his Chinese counterpart, General Wei Fenghe, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual gathering of military bigwigs in Singapore from May 31st to June 2nd.\n\nIt was an emollient gesture in fractious times. When Banyan asked Mr Shanahan what he planned to say to General Wei in private, the answer was not a tirade about Huawei or the South China Sea. Instead Mr Shanahan said he was \u201cexcited\u201d to explore areas of co-operation. North Korean sanctions-busting\u2014which often occurs in Chinese waters\u2014was top of the list. Such collaboration would show that America and China could \u201ccompete in a constructive way\u201d.\n\nOn June 1st the Pentagon published its plans for that competition in an Indo-Pacific strategy. At its heart was the idea of a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\u201d (FOIP), a nebulous concept conceived by Japan and enthusiastically taken up by the Trump administration. In essence, FOIP is a rules-based rejoinder to China\u2019s vision of spheres of influence, gunboat diplomacy and murky loans. \u201cNo one nation can or should dominate the Indo-Pacific,\u201d said the Pentagon in its report.\n\nMr Shanahan\u2019s notion of responsible competition\u2014in contrast to the no-holds-barred clash of civilisations favoured by some of his head-banging colleagues\u2014is laudable. It is also savvy. Asian states are likelier to sign up to FOIP if they are persuaded that America is not spoiling for a fight. But on both counts\u2014stabilising the relationship with China, while rallying partners to push back against it\u2014America has an uphill task.\n\nStart with the olive branches. General Wei did not so much ignore them as snap them into pieces. \u201cArise, all those who do not want be enslaved,\u201d he thundered in his speech on June 2nd, quoting China\u2019s national anthem. \u201cLet us build the new Great Wall with our flesh and blood.\u201d He warned that China\u2019s army was \u201cnot afraid of sacrifice\u201d and that \u201cwe make no promise to renounce the use of force\u201d against Taiwan.\n\nOne might think that such bluster would send Asians rushing to sign up to FOIP and into America\u2019s arms. In some cases, it has. Narendra Modi will deepen defence ties with America in his second term. Japan is beefing up its armed forces and sending its navy into the South China Sea. Officials from America, Australia, India and Japan\u2014the \u201cQuad\u201d\u2014now confer routinely, most recently on May 31st.\n\nAll pay lip service to the idea that the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), a club of ten mostly smaller powers, should be at the core of FOIP. The problem is that not all in ASEAN are sold on the idea. For one thing, many are unconvinced that America will truly stick around, as the costs of any war with China grow over time. So why risk China\u2019s ire? \u201cThe Chinese coast guard is bigger than Malaysia\u2019s warships,\u201d lamented Malaysia\u2019s defence minister.\n\nMr Shanahan did his best to assuage these concerns. He pointed out that the Indo-Pacific was America\u2019s \u201cpriority theatre\u201d, with four times as many American forces as any other American military command. America\u2019s freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea were also growing more routine: unusually, there were two in May alone.\n\nBut muscle is only half of it. The larger issue is that Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictably incendiary foreign policy sits uneasily with the principles of FOIP. Tensions with Iran are pulling America\u2019s attention back to the Middle East. The compulsive resort to tariffs undercuts a rules-based trading order. Mr Trump\u2019s lack of interest in human rights hardly furthers freedom. And to many in Asia, America\u2019s war on Huawei or its sanctions against buyers of Russian arms or Iranian oil look an awful lot like China\u2019s \u201ctoolkit of coercion\u201d, as Mr Shanahan put it.\n\nThat is unfair. An Asian order sculpted by China would be more capricious and suffocating than anything Mr Trump could devise. General Wei\u2019s brazen defence of the Tiananmen Square massacre\u2014he called it a \u201ccorrect policy\u201d that gave China the stability to grow richer\u2014was a reminder of the ideological stakes. Australia, India and Japan are on board. Singapore and Vietnam\u2019s sympathies are clear. But most ASEAN countries hate the idea of taking sides, despite widespread misgivings about China\u2019s intentions. Mr Shanahan reckons they will eventually come round. \u201cI think they\u2019re building up their confidence,\u201d he says.Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Britain goes well\u2014at least for him", "title": "\u201cManga\u201d continues at the British Museum until August 26th Asian countries fear China, but many won\u2019t side with America", "poster": "", "source": "economist", "badges": ["Economy"], "publisher": "admin", "pushOrg": false, "pubMod": true, "suggestedfocus": "13.1 Minutes", "wordsset": 407, "keywords": "America,Asian,China,FOIP,General,Shanahan,Trump,defence", "toughwords": ["sanction", "Pentagon", "grainy", "aerial", "counterpart", "bigwig", "emollient", "fractious", "Banyan", "tirade", "bust", "collaboration", "constructive", "nebulous", "conceive", "enthusiastically", "essence", "rejoinder", "sphere", "gunboat", "diplomacy", "murky", "dominate", "clash", "laudable", "savvy", "likelier", "rally", "uphill", "olive", "enslave", "thunder", "quot", "anthem", "flesh", "sacrifice", "renounce", "bluster", "navy", "Quad", "confer", "routinely", "unconvinced", "ire", "coast", "warship", "lament", "assuage", "priority", "navigation", "routine", "unpredictably", "incendiary", "compulsive", "resort", "tariff", "undercut", "awful", "toolkit", "coercion", "sculpt", "capricious", "suffocate", "brazen", "massacre", "stability", "richer", "ideological", "sympathy", "reckon"], "allwords": 645}
